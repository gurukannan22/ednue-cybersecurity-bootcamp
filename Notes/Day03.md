# 📚 **IAAA – Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability**  


Today, we will learn about **IAAA**, which is essential for securing computer systems and networks. It helps in managing who can access what, ensuring security.

## **🔹 IAAA - The Four Pillars of Security**  

| **Concept** | **What It Means** | **Example** |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| **Identification** | Who are you? | Entering your username on a website |
| **Authentication** | Prove you are who you say you are | Entering your password or OTP |
| **Authorization** | What are you allowed to do? | Viewing files but not deleting them |
| **Accountability** | Tracking actions taken by a user | Logging who accessed the database and when |

### **1️⃣ Identification – Who Are You?**
📌 **Definition:** Identification is the process of claiming an identity. It helps a system know who is trying to access it.  

💡 **Real-World Example:**  
- When you enter an office building, you tell the security guard your name.  
- Entering your **email ID or username** in a login page.  

🔒 **Cybersecurity Example:**  
- Typing your **username** while logging into Gmail.  
- A swipe card with your employee ID at a company.

### **2️⃣ Authentication – Prove You Are Who You Say You Are**
📌 **Definition:** Authentication verifies your identity by checking credentials like passwords, OTPs, or biometrics.  

💡 **Real-World Example:**  
- The security guard checks your **ID card** to confirm you are an employee.  
- Entering a **password or OTP** after typing your username.  

🔒 **Types of Authentication:**  
✔ **Something You Know** – Password, PIN  
✔ **Something You Have** – OTP on phone, ID card  
✔ **Something You Are** – Fingerprint, Face ID  

📌 **Cybersecurity Example:**  
- Logging into a banking app using **password + OTP** (Multi-Factor Authentication).  
- Unlocking your phone with **Face ID or fingerprint**.

### **3️⃣ Authorization – What Can You Do?**
📌 **Definition:** Authorization determines what actions a user is allowed to perform after authentication.  

💡 **Real-World Example:**  
- A **security pass** lets employees enter certain office areas but not the CEO’s office.  
- A college student can **view their marks online** but cannot edit them.  

🔒 **Cybersecurity Example:**  
- A **user** can read emails but cannot delete emails from other accounts.  
- A **bank employee** can see customer details but **cannot approve loans**.  

---

### **4️⃣ Accountability – Tracking User Actions**
📌 **Definition:** Accountability ensures that all user activities are tracked and recorded. If something goes wrong, we can find out **who did what and when**.  

💡 **Real-World Example:**  
- A CCTV camera in a bank records who enters and leaves.  
- A **restaurant bill** shows what food was ordered.  

🔒 **Cybersecurity Example:**  
- **Audit logs** track when an employee logs into a company system.  
- **Online banking logs** record all transactions with timestamps.

## **📖 Summary**
| **IAAA Concept** | **Purpose** | **Example** |
|------------------|------------|------------|
| **Identification** | Claims identity | Username, Email ID |
| **Authentication** | Proves identity | Password, OTP, Face ID |
| **Authorization** | Defines permissions | Viewing vs. editing files |
| **Accountability** | Tracks user activity | Audit logs, CCTV footage |
