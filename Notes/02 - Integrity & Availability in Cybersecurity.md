# **ðŸ“š Integrity & Availability in Cybersecurity**  

In cybersecurity, the **CIA Triad** helps protect information. Yesterday, we learned about **Confidentiality** (keeping data secret). Today, we focus on:  

âœ… **Integrity** â€“ Ensuring data is correct and unchanged  
âœ… **Availability** â€“ Ensuring data is accessible when needed

### **ðŸ”¹ Integrity (Protecting Data from Tampering)**  
**Definition:** Integrity ensures that data is **correct, unchanged, and not modified by unauthorized people**.  

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**  
Imagine you send â‚¹500 via Paytm, but a hacker changes it to â‚¹5,000 before it reaches your friend. Integrity prevents such changes.  

ðŸ”’ **How is Integrity Maintained?**  
âœ” **Checksums** â€“ Like tracking numbers to verify data integrity  
âœ” **Digital Signatures** â€“ Like electronic signatures to verify authenticity  
âœ” **Backups** â€“ Keeping extra copies of important files  

ðŸ“Œ **Real-World Examples:**  
- Wikipedia stores a **history of edits** to prevent false information.  
- Banks use **integrity checks** to prevent unauthorized changes in transactions.

### **ðŸ”¹ Availability (Ensuring Data is Always Accessible)**  
**Definition:** Availability ensures that **systems, websites, and data are accessible whenever users need them**.  

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**  
If an ATM is down when you need cash, it's an availability failure.  

ðŸ’» **How is Availability Ensured?**  
âœ” **Backup Servers** â€“ Extra servers take over if one fails  
âœ” **Load Balancing** â€“ Distributes website traffic to prevent crashes  
âœ” **DDoS Protection** â€“ Defends against attacks that shut down websites  

ðŸ“Œ **Real-World Examples:**  
- **Amazon & Flipkart** handle festival sale traffic with backup servers.  
- **Google Drive** is available 24/7 because Google has servers worldwide.  
- **Hospitals' Patient Records** must always be accessible for emergency treatments.
