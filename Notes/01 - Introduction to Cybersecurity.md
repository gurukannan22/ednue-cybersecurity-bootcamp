---

### **1. What is Cybersecurity?**  
Cybersecurity is the practice of **protecting computer systems, networks, and data** from cyber threats such as hacking, malware, and data breaches.  

#### **Why is Cybersecurity Important?**  
✔ Protects against **hackers, viruses, and data theft**  
✔ Ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)** of data  
✔ Helps prevent **financial and reputational damage**

### **2. Difference Between Cybersecurity, IT Security, and Information Security**  

| **Term**           | **Focus**                                  | **Example** |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Cybersecurity**  | Protecting digital systems & networks    | Preventing website hacking |
| **IT Security**    | Securing both physical & digital assets  | Limiting access to server rooms |
| **Information Security** | Ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability | Encrypting sensitive files |

### **3. The CIA Triad - The Foundation of Cybersecurity**  
The **CIA Triad** consists of:  
1. **Confidentiality:** Protecting data from unauthorized access  
   - Example: **Encryption, strong passwords, access controls**  
2. **Integrity:** Ensuring data is not modified or corrupted  
3. **Availability:** Making sure data is accessible when needed  

📌 **Today’s Focus - Confidentiality:**  
Confidentiality ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive data.  

✔ **Ways to Ensure Confidentiality:**  
- **Encryption** (e.g., AES, RSA)  
- **Access Control** (e.g., passwords, biometrics)  
- **Data Masking** (e.g., hiding credit card numbers in databases)  

📌 **Example:**  
When you enter your Gmail password, it is encrypted to prevent hackers from stealing it.
